Here is a challenge to Microsoft or Microsort Supporters to defend the pathetic state of DOS 6 as an upgrade distribution -- it is a long story but would make good reading for those who are interested in knowing the potential pitfalls of \"upgrading\" to DOS 6 that I have been able to notice after only about a week of playing around with it.\n",
            "  My envorinment ==============  TI TravelMate 4000 WinSX (486SX/25) 4M Ram 120M Disk System BIOS version 1.03 05/21/92 by Texas Instruments CL-GD6420 VGA BIOS v 1.03 a1 by Cirrus Logic & Quadtel Advance Power Manager BATTERY.PRO v b6.00 by Texas Instruments Smart Drive Cache (WIN3.1/DOS6) Parameters: 2048 1024 a- b- Windows Benchmark WinBench(tm) v 3.11 02/11/93 by ZD Labs  After \"updgrading\" to DOS 6, I could not understand why certain things became so slow, especially after I decided to try 'dblspace'.\n",
            "  In the process of finding out why, I discovered some interesting things.\n",
            "   Disk Performance with Double Space and Smart Drive ==================================================  While most things did not appear to slow down most of the time, certain applications appeared to run very much slower.\n",
            "  What was interesting is that commands like 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' were running far too slowly to consider them useful by any standards.\n",
            "  I suspected Double Space (DS) and decided to measure its impact on my system using WinBench(tm).\n",
            "  The Real Disk WINMARK of 20350 for the original system (as shipped from factory with DOS 5 and Windowws 3.1) became 10718 when \"upgraded\" to DOS 6 with DS.\n",
            "  Thus there is an effective performance degradation of more than 50 percent which did not really surprise me because I knew that DS compression must cost something.\n",
            "  Specifically, for short sequential reads up to 512 bytes, DS actually *improves* transfer rates by about 10% (because CPU being faster than I/O, more CPU cycles needed for DS is more than compensated by savings in I/O cycles).\n",
            "  However, for all other cases, particularly large random writes, the transfers take up to three times as long.\n",
            "  While the performance depends on the type of access (i.e random or sequential, small or large transfer units), on the average (based on WinBench's assumptions), the disk slows down to half its speed.\n",
            "  The tests alone, done in 'real mode' (see WinBench) and with smartdrv on, do not say much except that it helps to put into those subjective statements like 'there is no noticable difference in performance' or even that 'it will speed up disk access when you have a fast CPU and slow disk I/O'.\n",
            "  This explained why some applications ran markedly slower, but not why 'chkdsk' and 'defrag' (the latter especially) too so long.\n",
            "   Double Space and Windows ========================  DBLSPACE will not run at all from within windows, not even if you wanted to only to get information, not modify anything, or for that matter even check on its usage -- try \"fasthelp dblspace\" in a dos box within windows and you will see what I mean from the error message you get.\n",
            "  How narrow minded can a programer get, I wonder.\n",
            "  Yes, this information can be obtained through the mstools.dd add-on to file manager, but this 'mstools' dll does not understand a compressed floppy!\n",
            "  (Use the DOS 6 supplement utility to create a compressed floppy if you dont know how to.)   DOS 6 Defragmenter is incompatible with TI APM ==============================================  Defragmentation seemed to take too much time.\n",
            "  Even so, I waited patiently till it finished and then ran it again to just to confirm.\n",
            " This confirmation 'dblspace /def' command for the 120M drive should take no more than 30 seconds (much faster on other defragmenters I have used) but it took 12 minutes.\n",
            "  I discovered that if I moved the mouse, defragmentation checking ran faster (the % figure ticked more rapidly).\n",
            "  It dawned on me that this had to do with TI's battery saver Advanced Power Management (APM) module which slows the clock down when it thinks that the CPU is idle, and it obviously thought DS defragmentation was an idle process!\n",
            "  After disabling the TI's power saver, this operation took only 20 seconds.\n",
            "   Microsft programmers think TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD users are idiots ====================================================================  In the readme.txt file, you can find the the following   Running Microsoft Backup with TI4000 and Gateway NOMAD computers  ----------------------------------------------------------------  To avoid a conflict between the Turbo feature and Microsoft Backup  for Windows or MS-DOS, add a /L0 switch to the DEVICE command in  your CONFIG.SYS that loads the BATTERY.PRO file.\n",
            " Or, before you  run Microsoft Backup, type SETPOWER /L0 at the command prompt.\n",
            "  If you checked TI's manual on the /L0 option, you will realise that it means \"disable all power saving features of your notebook\".\n",
            "  Why would anyone want to run a driver disabled!\n",
            "  As I have found out, not only does TI's power management interfere with Microsoft Backup as the readme.txt claims, but 'chkdsk' and 'dblspace' (and who knows what else) are crippled by the TI's power saver.\n",
            "  It is obvious that there is not such thing as APM specifications.\n",
            "  If there indeed is such a thing, then either Microsoft programmers or TI programmers dont know how to read these specifications.\n",

            "  This figure of 60% seems to be the steady state value on my notebook when I am running nothing (windows with only program manager in iconised form).\n",
            "  Does that mean that Windows takes up 40% of my CPU all for itself, and that I have at best only 60% left for useful work?\n",
            "  Is such an overhead justified  (whether or not Windows is an operating system or just another user interface)?\n",
            "  (In DOS alone, it reports 99% idle time.)  Looks like Windows is a good example of busy waiting type of package that I like my students to study as the classical 'negative' example of our times!\n",

            "  As a result, my resultant path has so many DOS's.\n",
            "  If the installation program wanted to remove the old DOS path, and add the new DOS path, clearly it has to only scan for the path statement containg the old DOS directory and replace it by the new DOS path.\n",
            " (Even this should only be done if the new DOS is installed in a directory different from the old one being 'upgraded'.)  Instead, the Microsoft programmer (if you can call this person one) decided to meddle every path statement I had in the autoexec and prepend DOS to the value.\n",
            "  I wonder if Microsoft is so desparate that it would not fire programmers who are incapable of the thought process.\n",
            "  I started a thread on this when DOS 4 came up, and the Microsoft representative in Singapore called me about this poster.\n",
            "  In fact he specifically said his US counterparts saw the poster and relayed the information to him as he did not have access to internet.\n",
            "  Now that has not changed one bit.\n",
            "  In fact, if you have a PATH statement with %PATH% already in it, is it not obvious that the this statement should not be touched for any reason?\n",

            " C:\\ETC\\MOUSE\\MOUSE.COM  Why is it so difficult just to replace loadhigh with LH and its parameters, without touching the rest of the line, I do not understand.\n",
            "   DOS 6 Software Quality ======================  DOS 6 is the only operating system I know, in which, under normal usage, you end up creating a file that you cannot get rid of using of the commands that come with it.\n",
            "  I am deliberately being cryptic about this:  I challenge Microsoft to use all its programmers to catch this bug and publish it.\n",
            "  If they dont within a week, I will post how you can create this \"ghost\" file.\n",
            "  Surely if I can pick this bug without even looking for it after using a particular command only twice, I am sure two dozen Microsoft (idiot) programmers randomly banging on their keyboards over a week could find it -- that is what I was told how Microsoft \"tests the quality\" of their products.\n",
            "  I think it is funny that Microsoft has found ways to \"test quality\" when it is accepted in the industry that quality cannot be tested, but can only be built into the product.\n",
            "  No wonder they cannot provide any form of guarantees on their products, not even a decent list of bugs that will prevent scores of user from destroying their disks beyond repair!\n",
            "  Also, if you run 'dblspace /def' often enough, repeatedly when the disk is fully defragmented, you may get errors, that was created by the defragmenters.\n",

            "  You also will hear people saying that Microsoft recommends that you not use JOIN.\n",
            "  But, in Microsoft's Windows 4 Workgroups Resource toolkit, the following appears:    \"JOIN, an MS-DOS utility, works fine with Windows for Workgroups 3.1 if   you do not change the state of the joined drives during a Windows for   Workgroups 3.1 session.\n",
            " This includes adding or removing joined drives   from within Windows for Workgroups.\n",
            " We recommend that you do not use   JOIN when running Windows Setup or Windows for Workgroups 3.1.\"  Within this caveat, JOIN appears to be valid under windows.\n",
            "  However, I have found a couple of applications that don't deal well with filesystems that have been \"mounted\" using join.\n",
            "  In particular, the worst offender is Word for Windows 2.0x.\n",
            "  It gets very confused when you edit and then try to save a file on a joined drive.\n",
            " It wants to create the saved file as ~NNNNN.tmp in the current dir, then delete the old file and rename the ~NNNNN.tmp file to the *.doc file.\n",
            "  Unfortunately, WfW usually writes the ~NNNNN.tmp file in some idiotic place other than the current directory (often in the root dir of the joined filesystem, but not always).\n",
            "  Then, after deleting the original *.doc file, it can't find the ~NNNNN.tmp file to rename it.\n",
            "  Unless you search your disk systems, the document is gone.\n",
            "  I have also found subtle problems using the MKS toolkit from a DOS box when JOINed filesystems are present.\n",
            "  I used to join c:\\temp with a 4meg ramdisk, but MKS sometimes gets confused when doing an \"ls\" on the c:\\temp dir, and misses some files in the temp dir.\n",
            "  (This is difficult to  reproduce, but it goes away totally when JOIN is not used.)  I think this is a Windows problem, rather than MKS's, since it works OK under raw DOS.\n",
            "  So, I would suggest that you can use JOIN, but be aware that it may not be as robust you would like.\n",
            "  Wouldn't it be real great to \"mount\" network drives (i.e.\n",
            " Z:) under the main file tree, rather than having all those darned drive letters?\n",

            "  It's too bad the JOIN command is not better implemented, since it would avoid using all those stupid drive letters.\n",

            "   I just got off the phone with MS Access support and was told that they (Microsoft) has decided to implement, as a standard for software support, the LOCAL setup (described below) as the \"most advantageous installation\".\n",
            " If this is true and Microsoft deems this to be the most prudent installation then I will comply but I'd like to hear it from administrators first.\n",
            "   The LOCAL Windows Installation: ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Windows is fully installed on each workstation hard drive (assuming the resources are available).\n",
            "  From a network administrator's implementation, he/she would install all windows disks on a network drive using SETUP/A.\n",
            " Then install windows on a per/machine bases by running SETUP off the network to install the complete system on the local drives.\n",
            "  In this way, all drivers are available to the SETUP procedure w/o the need to change disks.\n",
            "   Advantages: - Reduce Traffic - Running Windows locally reduces network traffic due to   the local access of main Windows files.\n",
            " - Network independence - If the network fails (and they all do at one point   or another), the local installation would allow users to keep producing   and reduce the cost of down-time.\n",
            " - Faster Windows - Theoretically, Windows will run faster from a local hard   drive than over a network.\n",
            "  This may be a hard point to prove if the network   has an optical backbone and/or the network drives are significantly faster   access than local ones.\n",
            " - A user traveling from machine to machine does not need to worry about   varying setups (monochrome, color, types of mouse, etc...) since the   Windows installation is assigned to the Workstation.\n",
            "   Disadvantages: - Cost - Installing Windows locally requires a significant amount of disk   space.\n",
            "  Workstations now must be purchased with a hard disk that can   increase the cost of the workstation from 10 to 30 percent.\n",
            " - Administration - Local windows installations are very difficult to administer.\n",
            "   New drivers for peripherals are constantly being made available, each of   which would have to be individually installed on each workstation.\n",
            " - Security - Users now have access to erase or corrupt their own system   files from simple ignorance.\n",
            "  This could result in quite a headache for   administrators who may have to constantly repair damaged installations.\n",
            " - Backup - We all know the problems backing up local hard disks.\n",
            "  The backup   sets (if done via a centralized tape system) get very large very quickly.\n",
            "   Backup individually (to floppy) may not happen at all.\n",
            "  This may be   eliminated if it is assumed that local hard disks only contain replaceable   applications and *not* user data.\n",
            "   The SHARED Windows Installation ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Windows is fully installed to a network disk via the SETUP/A procedure described above.\n",
            "  Users (or administrators) then install a minimal set of files to individual \"user\" directories.\n",
            "  These directories may be on a local hard disk or perhaps a network \"home\" directory.\n",
            "  The bulk of the Windows system files are maintained on the network in a single directory (some 400+ files) and are accessed (shared) as-needed by users throughout their Windows session.\n",
            "  The user's files consist of a small set of files that the user has updated during his/her Windows session.\n",
            "  These include group files, .INI files and other regularly updated files.\n",
            "   Advantages: - A single location for all files makes updates to drives easy.\n",
            "  As   an updated driver becomes available, it only needs to be installed in this   single directory for all users to be able to take advantage of it.\n",
            " - Assuming that the users' files are maintained in network (home) directories,   the administrator can easily edit any .INI file as-needed to correct   problems that may arise.\n",
            "  This includes WIN.INI and SYSTEM.INI.\n",
            " - Backup of all pertinent files is done easily.\n",
            "  Even if the users' files   are on a local hard disk, the bulk of the Windows system is backed up with   all driver updates.\n",
            "   Disadvantages: - Network traffic - since all Windows files are being shared in a network   directory, traffic on the network can become a problem an effect the   speed of Windows.\n",
            " - If the network crashes, all production comes to a stop since Window's   is reliant upon the network for its files.\n",
            "  Loss of data usually occurs   as well since users working in Windows at the time of the crash will   usually not be able to save their work.\n",
            " - Although minimal, disk space is still a consideration.\n",
            "  If the users' files   are maintained on the network, a large number of users can cause a   significant utilization of disk space due to their personal Windows   files alone.\n",
            " - Users cannot easily move from machine to machine unless the workstation   hardware are similar.\n",
            "  This is due to the Windows installation being   tied to a particular username (in the case of Network user files).\n",
            "    The Discussion ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I would like to know, from other administrators with a large Windows userbase, how they prefer setting up Windows.\n",
            "  Personally, I have setup numerous installations using the SHARED setup.\n",
            "  All Windows and application files are on the network with little or no utilization of local hard disks.\n",
            "  In fact, I sold a network on the fact that the company would no longer need to purchase hard disks for their workstations and thus save that much more money.\n",
            "   I would also like to see recommendations for applications.\n",
            "  Should apps such as Word and/or Excel be installed locally regardless of how Windows is installed?\n",
            "  Again, I keep all files on the network for easy backup and administration but this is \"putting all eggs in one basket\"; if the network crashes, work comes to a halt.\n",
            "   Now I am sure Microsoft (and I know your out there) has their own ideas about this and their insights would be of great value but I hope to hear from people with \"actual\" working experience with users and network administration.\n"
